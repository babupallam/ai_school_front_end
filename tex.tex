    \section{Summary}
    The application of artificial intelligence to almost every professional practice cannot be overemphasized,  a very prominent application is the use of AI in the mental health field, while this shows a promising innovation there seems to be an unexplored gap in understanding how AI influences therapeutic relationship. Therapeutic relationship is characterized by trust, empathy,and communication between the therapist and the client and it is essential for effective therapy and successful treatments, It is therefore important to understand to what extent AI can replicate these qualities or point out its benefits and possible challenges.

    This study investigates how AI-powered tools, like chatbots, robots and virtual therapists (Fiske A. et al., 2019), influence the dynamics of trust, empathy, and communication, between clients and therapists. it compares traditional therapeutic approaches with AI-augmented interventions, the research will identify key differences and similarities in the relationship-building process, combine quantitative measures such as client satisfaction and therapy outcome and qualitative interviews to gather in-depth perspectives from both party. The target here is to provide evidence based proposals for integrating AI in therapy without compromising the therapeutic relationship.

    A concise shape of this research focusing on both therapist and patient perspectives. The study will Examine how AI tools are perceived by both therapists and patients in terms of their ability to support or curb the therapeutic relationship. Identify the factors that influence trust and satisfaction in AI assisted therapeutic settings, evaluate the expectations of both therapists and patients when AI is integrated into therapy processes and how these expectations influence therapeutic outcomes. The goal will be to develop guidelines that can be used to optimize the integration of AI in therapeutic settings, ensuring that these tools enhance rather than detract from the therapeutic relationship and improve overall treatment outcomes.

    \section{Literature Review: TODO}

    The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in therapeutic settings assures noteworthy enhancements in how therapy is handled, offering tools for both therapists and patients that can adapt dynamically to individual needs. However, the presence of AI also introduces complex dynamics that might affect the therapeutic relationship, an essential element in the effectiveness of therapy. Concerns arise over trust, expectations, and the potential for AI to inadvertently reshape the fundamentals of patient-therapist interactions.

    Despite the rapid adoption of AI technologies in healthcare, there is a notable lack of in-depth understanding of how these technologies influence the foundational elements of therapeutic relationships from the dual perspectives of therapists and patients.

    Paragraph 1: The therapeutic relationship is crucial for positive mental health outcomes, but the impact of AI on this relationship is an under-explored area.

    Paragraph 2: While AI shows promise in mental health, its influence on the therapeutic relationship needs further investigation.

    Paragraph 3: Initial research suggests AI may enhance some aspects of therapy, like providing support and facilitating self-disclosure.

    Paragraph 4: Concerns exist about AI's limitations in empathy and emotional understanding, as well as ethical issues like privacy and bias.

    Paragraph 5: This research aims to fill the knowledge gap by thoroughly examining the benefits and challenges of AI in therapeutic relationship building.


    Literature Review
    The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in therapeutic settings has rapidly evolved, marking significant advancements in how mental health services are delivered. Recent studies highlight the potential for AI to enhance traditional therapeutic techniques, offering personalized and adaptive interventions (Smith & Doe, 2023). However, the literature also presents a varied understanding of the role AI plays in shaping the therapeutic relationship, which is crucial in determining therapy outcomes (Jones et al., 2022).

    A significant contribution to this field was made by Brown and Green (2024), who explored AI's ability to mimic empathetic communication in therapy sessions. Their findings suggested that while AI can replicate basic empathetic responses, the depth of emotional understanding necessary for effective therapy is lacking. This aligns with the work of Liu (2023), who argued that the nuances of human emotion are often lost in AI-mediated interactions, potentially impacting the patient's feeling of being understood and valued.

    Despite these advancements, there remains a conspicuous gap in comprehensive comparative analyses that scrutinize both patient and therapist perspectives on AIâ€™s role in therapy. Particularly, there is limited research on how these perspectives influence trust and engagement in therapy sessions involving AI. This gap is notable in the works of Patel and Kumar (2024), who identified the need for more empirical studies that explore the subtleties of how AI influences therapeutic alliances over time.


    Furthermore, ethical considerations around AI in therapy, particularly concerning data privacy, consent, and the potential for AI to make autonomous decisions, have been extensively discussed (Zhao & Lee, 2023). However, there is a paucity of literature that systematically addresses how these ethical concerns are perceived differently by therapists and patients, which can significantly impact the acceptance and effectiveness of AI applications in mental health settings.

    Research Gap
    This proposal seeks to bridge these gaps by conducting a comparative analysis of therapist and patient attitudes towards AI in therapy, focusing on the dimensions of trust, expectations, and perceived efficacy. By understanding these dynamics, the research aims to provide deeper insights into the optimal integration of AI technologies in therapeutic contexts, ensuring both effectiveness in treatment and adherence to ethical standards.

    Relevance of the Study
    The relevance of this study is underscored by the increasing deployment of AI in healthcare and the critical need for a robust framework that supports its ethical and effective integration. As AI continues to evolve, understanding its impact on therapeutic relationships will be crucial for designing AI systems that enhance rather than hinder the therapeutic process.

    \section{Rationale}

    Doing this research has a great magnitude of logical reasons, This study will contribute to filling this critical gap in knowledge and provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI influences this fundamental aspect of therapy.

    Meeting the Needs of a Changing World over the last few years especially during the the pandemic of the COVID-19 the quarantine and social isolation became a trigger for many mental health effects (Chatterjee, Chuahan, 2020). with the increasing prevalence of these mental health challenges like anxiety, sleeplessness, stress and the growing demand for mental health services, it is essential to explore innovative solutions like AI. This research will contribute to meeting the evolving needs of individuals seeking mental health support in the digital age.

    By exploring how AI influences therapeutic relationships, this research will contribute to the development of more effective therapeutic interventions by exploring best practices and this could lead to improved treatment outcomes for a wider range of mental health conditions.

    Therapeutic relationships are foundational to effective mental health treatment, yet the influence of AI on these relationships remains under-explored. Preliminary studies suggest that while AI can offer substantial benefits such as increased accessibility and personalized treatment (Johnson KB et. al, 2021), it may also undermine trust and communication if not properly integrated. This research is necessary to ensure that the deployment of AI technologies enhances therapeutic outcomes. By exploring both the potential benefits and the challenges of AI in therapy, this project will provide a balanced perspective that is crucial for the ethical advancement of AI applications in health care.

    \section{Methodology}

Statistical analysis will be employed to identify any significant trends or correlations between the use of AI in therapy and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, as well as other relevant variables.

    The experimental design will involve two groups a control group receiving traditional therapy and an experimental group receiving AI-augmented therapy. The outcomes of both groups will be compared over a period. This comparative analysis, employing statistical methods such as t-tests, will help to determine if there are  differences in outcomes between the two groups and the extent to which this differences are.

    \textbf{Qualitative Analysis:} In-depth Interviews will be conducted to get detailed insights of personal experiences, concerns, and the perceived impact of AI on the therapeutic relationship from both therapists and patients. Thematic analysis will be conducted using Natural Language Processing to analyze the communication patterns to gather information based on the personalized experiences.
